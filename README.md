## 🚀 Getting Started
Set up the web monorepo for Convērs and start building your applications with ease. Leverage shared components, utilities, and configurations to accelerate your workflow.

---

## 🔧 Requirements
Ensure the following tools are installed:
- **Node.js** (>= 20.x)
- **npm** (>= 10.x) or **yarn** (>= 1.x)
- **Docker engine** (optional for API integration)
- **pnpm** (>= 9.x) for efficient dependency management in the monorepo

## 📂 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/convrz/web.git
cd web
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Use `pnpm` to install dependencies across all workspaces:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Set up environment variables by creating a `.env.local` file in the root directory and populating it as follows:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.convrz.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Convrz
```

### 4. Run the Development Server
Start the development server for apps:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 💻 Development

### Monorepo Architecture
This project uses a monorepo structure for efficient code sharing across apps and packages. All reusable components, utilities, and configurations are centralized in the `packages/` directory.

### Code Quality
We enforce code quality and standards using **ESLint 9** and **Prettier**. To lint your code:
```bash
pnpm lint
```

### Styling
**Tailwind CSS** is used for utility-first styling. Modify or extend styles in the `tailwind.config.js` file located in `packages/config/`.

### Component Management
This project leverages **ShadCN's Monorepo** for shared components. Add new components using the command:
```bash
pnpm shadcn add [component-name]
```
Refer to the [ShadCN documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) for guidance.

### Building for Production
Build the application for production:
```bash
pnpm build
```
The output will be generated in the `.next/` directory for each app.

## 🏗️ Monorepo Features

### Dependency Management
Using **PNPM** ensures efficient dependency management with:
- **Deduplication**: Dependencies are installed only once and reused across workspaces.
- **Strict Versioning**: Each app/package has isolated version control.

### Turbo-powered Builds
**Turborepo** accelerates builds and task execution by caching and optimizing tasks such as `build`, `lint`, and `test`.

### Shared Packages
The `packages/` directory centralizes reusable code, reducing duplication and enhancing maintainability.

### Incremental Development
Workspaces enable independent development and testing of apps/packages, allowing teams to iterate faster.
